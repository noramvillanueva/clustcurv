# clustcurv 3.0.0 (2025-11-14)

* A new argument `method` has been added to the `survclustcurv()` function.
  This argument allows selecting the testing procedure used to determine the number of groups.
  The default is `method = "LR"`.

  Supported values are:

  - `"LR"`: Log-Rank test; sensitive to late differences.
  - `"GB"`: Gehan–Breslow (generalized Wilcoxon); detects early differences.
  - `"TW"`: Tarone–Ware; detects early differences.
  - `"PP"`: Peto–Peto modified survival estimate; more robust than Tarone–Ware or Gehan–Breslow, detects early differences.
  - `"mPP"`: Modified Peto–Peto (Andersen).
  - `"FH"`: Fleming–Harrington (p = 1, q = 1).
  - `"bootstrap"`: Villanueva, Sestelo & Meira-Machado bootstrap procedure (the procedure implemented in previous package versions).




# clustcurv 3.0.1 (2025-12-05)

* Minor updates that do not affect the procedure's functionality.
