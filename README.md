# clustcurv:Determining Groups in Multiples Curves for survival, regression and competing risks analysis.


```clustcurv``` is an R package that provides a method for determining groups in multiple 
curves with an automatic selection of their number based on k-means or
k-medians algorithms. The selection of the optimal number is provided by
bootstrap methods. The methodology can be applied in regression, survival and
cumulative incidence functions.
