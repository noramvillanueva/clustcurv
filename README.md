# clustcurv: An R package for determining groups of curves in a survival context (WIP other context).

One important goal in survival analysis is the comparison of survival curves between groups. In many longitudinal survival studies one is often interested in assessing whether there are differences in survival among different groups of participants. For example, in a longitudinal medical study with a survival outcome, we might be interested in comparing survival between participants receiving different treatments, different age groups, racial/ethnic groups, geographic localization, etc. Several nonparametric methods have been proposed in the literature to test for the equality of survival curves for censored data. However, none of these methods can be used to determine groups among a series of survival curves. Naive approaches, such as pairwise comparisons, lead to a large number of comparisons making difficult the interpretations. Based on this, a new method is proposed which allows determining groups of survival curves with an automatic selection of their number. This method is implemented in the R clustcurv package and is illustrated using data from a colon cancer study.
