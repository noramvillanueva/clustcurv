# clustcurv
An R package for determining groups in multiple survival curves. There are some 
functions implemented, on the one hand, given a number of groups k, it can be 
determing which curves are similar or which ones not. On the other hand, when 
the number of groups k is unkonwn, a new procedure that let us not only the 
equality of the mulitple curves but also grouping them if they are not equal, 
with an automatic selection of the number.
